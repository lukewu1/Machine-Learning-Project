# Project Description
This is a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Cook County, Illinois.

In the first part of the notebook, I performed some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that lead to certain modeling decisions. Then, I added a few new features to the dataset, cleaning the data as well in the process.

In the next part of the notebook,  I fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict housing prices. 
I also analyzed the error of the model and brainstormed ways to improve the model's performance. 
Finally, I delved deeper into the implications of predictive modeling 
within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination 
in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, I also considered the impacts of my modeling results - thinking about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.
